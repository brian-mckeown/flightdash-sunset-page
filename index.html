                    <p>First and foremost, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to each and every one of you for your incredible support of FlightDash.io! Since launching the first AI cabin crew tool in 2023, it’s been an amazing journey bringing innovative tools to the flight simulation community.</p>
                    <p>As many of you know, AI technology has rapidly evolved, and the flightsim space has seen some exciting developments. One standout example is <a href="https://www.sayintentions.ai" target="_blank">SayIntentions.ai</a>, a platform offering AI-driven ATC, cabin crew, mentors, tour guides, dispatchers, and so much more on the horizon.</p>
                    <h5>🚀 My Next Chapter</h5>
                    <p>After connecting with the talented team behind <a href="https://www.sayintentions.ai" target="_blank">SayIntentions.ai</a>, I’m excited to announce that I will be shifting my focus and joining them as a community mentor and internal collaborator. I truly believe in their vision and dedication to pushing the boundaries of what AI can bring to our community—and I know they can deliver new features much faster than I could on my own.</p>
                    <h5>📅 What does this mean for FlightDash.io?</h5>
                    <p>After an amazing run, FlightDash.io will be officially sunset at the end of October 2024. While the platform will no longer be hosted after this date, I’ll be updating and sharing the open-source project on GitHub with clear instructions for those of you who’d like to continue using it locally on your own machine.</p>
                    <p>Please note that after October, all support, including Discord, will be closed, and there will be no further updates or enhancements. However, I’ll make sure all existing support articles are moved to the GitHub repository for reference.</p>
                    <h5>🗨️ Need Assistance?</h5>
                    <p>In the meantime, if you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask on Discord while we’re still live.</p>
